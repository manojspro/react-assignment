# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisite
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Installed on system
- Some prior knowledge with npm or yarn for installing dependencies.

## Steps

1.Open terminal(linux)or CMD(command prompt for Windows) and navigate to the folder you want to keep the Project on your system and run following command to clone the repository.

### `git clone https://github.com/manojspro/react-assignment.git`



2.The above command will clone the repository in a new folder on system named "react-assignment".
Navigate inside the Project Dir by running following command:

### `cd react-assignment`

3.We need to install all the dependecies(node packages) now so run following command.
### `npm install`
or
### `yarn install`

Note: for above commands to execute successfully we need stable network connectivity.
So re run the above steps in case you face any errors during the process.

4.We can run the Project using the following command. 

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
